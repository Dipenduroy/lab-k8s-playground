## Overview

This lab project is a playground for you to play with Kubernetes.

It can launch a multi-node cluster on your local machine in less than one minute even without network connection! 

It also supports to maintain multi-version Kubernetes clusters in parallel on your machine even includes the latest snapshot built from Kubernetes source!

The project also has a [Vagrant box](/Vagrantfile) that integrates a lot of popular Kubernetes applications and tools with best practices to make your daily work with Kubernetes more efficiently.
